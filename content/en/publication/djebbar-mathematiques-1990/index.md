title: "Mathematics and Mathematicians of the medieval Maghreb (IXth-XVIth centuries): Contribution\
  \ to the study of the scientific activities of the Moslem West"
subtitle: ''
summary: "The thesis brings together a part of the studies that I carried out in the history of mathematics, between 1980 and 1990. These studies concern the activities of teaching and mathematical research in the medieval Maghreb (9th-16th centuries) and they are essentially based on unpublished manuscripts, some of which were unknown until recent years. The mathematical disciplines that were the subject of my research are: algebra, the science of calculus, number theory, geometry and combinatorial analysis. The thesis also contains the critical edition of three Arabic mathematical texts accompanied by their French translation."
