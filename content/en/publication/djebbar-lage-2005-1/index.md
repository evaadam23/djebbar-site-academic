abstract: Astronomy, medicine, mathematics, geography ... so many fields in which the Arab-Muslim civilization made original contributions. Not only did she assimilate the Greek, Indian, Babylonian, Egyptian knowledge that she knew how to transmit at the time of the great translations, but she also developed a great scientific tradition specifically Arab, with great names like Ibn Sînâ (Avicenna), the mathematician and astronomer al-Khwârizmi or the scientist and polygraph Al-Bîrûnî, to name but a few ... Returning to the golden age of Arab sciences, between the 8th and 14th centuries, allows us to better understand this little-known heritage and to follow the circulation of knowledge in the Mediterranean, from Greece to medieval Europe.
