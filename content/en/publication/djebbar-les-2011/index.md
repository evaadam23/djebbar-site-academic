abstract: "In the libraries of the desert, manuscripts deal with scientific themes which involve mathematics and astronomy in various forms. This book makes us discover their wealth and diversity, while contextualizing this scientific tradition born in northern Africa at the beginning of the 9th century. In this bilingual version of the Nubdha fi ilm al-hisab, an unpublished Arabic manuscript probably dating from the beginning of the 20th century and, for the first time, translated into French, Ahmad Babir al-Arawani explains the processes of the so-called Indian calculation in the Arabic mathematical tradition."
