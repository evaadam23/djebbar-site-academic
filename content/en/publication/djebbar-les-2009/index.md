abstract: "For more than ten years, La main à la Pâte has actively contributed to the renewal of science education in France and in some thirty countries. In this spirit, in 2004 Le Pommier published L'Europe des Découverte, intended for teachers of cycle 3 and beginning of college. The originality of the book was to allow a constructive use of the history of science and technology to conduct experimental activities in the classroom. He proved that the use of history in the classroom also contributes to the construction of scientific and technical knowledge, and that it can help to modify the image of science itself. Driven by the same spirit of openness and curiosity, Les Découvertes en pays d'Islam this time gives pride of place to the scientific discoveries of what has come to be called the “golden age of Arab sciences”. Eight discoveries are presented: the astrolabe; the rainbow theory; vision and light ray; the symmetry ; distillation; the water pump; pulmonary circulation; the scales of wisdom. While allowing the teacher to deepen his scientific culture, the book provides him with the educational tools to carry out activities in class. Even if, like its predecessor, it is part of an educational and scientific framework, Les Découvertes en pays d'Islam goes far beyond its socio-educational implications: by introducing this period in the history of science to school. , the work not only contributes to making known the extraordinary scientific and technical production of the Arab-Muslim culture but also helps to distinguish the contributions of the cultures today associated in France with the most recent immigrations to the construction of a knowledge. universal and shared."
