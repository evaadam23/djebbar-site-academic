title: Al-Khwarizmi, Algebra and Indian Arithmetic
subtitle: ''
summary: "l-Khwârizmî, Algebra and Indian calculus.
The word algebra originates from the title of the work Kitâb al-jabr wa'l-muqabala, by the Persian astronomer, geographer and mathematician al-Khwârizmî (780-850). Widely translated and widespread in Europe, under the general term of Algorismus (which itself gave the word algorithm), we find the statement of distributivity, the so-called rule of signs, the solution of all types of quadratic equations and solving multiple problems..."

The word algebra originates from the title of the work Kitâb al-jabr wa'l-muqabala, by the Persian astronomer, geographer and mathematician al-Khwârizmî (780-850). Widely translated and widespread in Europe, under the general term of Algorismus (which itself gave the word algorithm), we find the statement of distributivity, the so-called rule of signs, the solution of all types of quadratic equations and solving multiple problems. Al-Khwârizmî had also written an important book for the dissemination of figures and the positional decimal system borrowed from India and its scholars: The Book on Indian Calculus."
