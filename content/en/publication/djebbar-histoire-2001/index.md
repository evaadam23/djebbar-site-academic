summary: "The history of Western science has long claimed that between the 'Greek miracle' and the Renaissance, utter obscurantism reigned. The reason returning, it appeared that the scholars of the countries of Islam, from the 8th to the 15th century, had certainly translated Greek and Indian works, but above all cleared the fields of science and technology which would not be established until much later in Europe..."

abstract: "The history of Western science has long claimed that between the 'Greek miracle' and the Renaissance, utter obscurantism reigned.

It is the long history of this unfairly ignored cultural blaze that is told here. From Baghdad in Andalusia, from the algorithms of al-Khwarizmi to the flowering of scholarly works, a whole civilization comes back to life, where freedom of thought and tolerance have come together to remarkably advance the common scientific heritage."
