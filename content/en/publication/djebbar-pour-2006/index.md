title: For the history of science and technology
subtitle: ''
summary: "Scientific advances have punctuated the transformations of contemporary culture. The history of science makes it possible to understand the evolution of knowledge, but also that of representations and ideas. Present in most school programs, it connects disciplinary fields. Memento for teachers, this book is a valuable analytical tool intended to introduce this perspective into teaching.
It recalls the objects and methods of the historian of science, presents the conceptions and visions of the world that have accompanied the scientific revolutions. It evokes the main aspects of the question through boxes and annotated bibliographies, without avoiding its political and social dimensions."
