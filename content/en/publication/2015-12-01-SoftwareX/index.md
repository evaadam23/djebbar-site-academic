title: COMP Superscalar, an interoperable programming framework
abstract: COMPSs is a programming framework that aims to facilitate the
  parallelization of existing applications written in Java, C/C++ and Python
  scripts. For that purpose, it offers a simple programming model based on
  sequential development in which the user is mainly responsible for (i)
  identifying the functions to be executed as asynchronous parallel tasks and
  (ii) annotating them with annotations or standard Python decorators. A runtime
  system is in charge of exploiting the inherent concurrency of the code,
  automatically detecting and enforcing the data dependencies between tasks and
  spawning these tasks to the available resources, which can be nodes in a
  cluster, clouds or grids. In cloud environments, COMPSs provides scalability
  and elasticity features allowing the dynamic provision of resources.
