title: Arabic algebra, genesis of an art
subtitle: ''
summary: "It is the strength of Arab-Muslim civilization to be nourished by practices, techniques, processes, traditions, ideas pre-existing in the civilizations encountered during its expansion. It is his wealth to have been able to develop an art that did not yet have the dignity of geometry or number theory. It is its specificity to have allowed authors speaking in Arabic, of various origins and faiths, to contribute to the development of this art. It is its characteristic - in a geopolitical area ranging from India to the Pyrenees - to possess a great cultural and scientific unity which has enabled its East to play a driving role in the maturation of algebra., To its Maghrebo West. - Andalusian to hold a preeminent role in part of its development and its circulation towards the Latin countries. [...] This book is enlightening for all those who are in love with culture, whether or not they are keen on algebra. It will be precious to mathematicians and essential to researchers [...]. Finally, he poses a political question that remains in the background: is it not when they are constituted by relying on the richness of otherness that civilizations prosper and flourish?"
