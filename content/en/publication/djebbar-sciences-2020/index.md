abstract: "The results of numerous researches carried out over the last two centuries, concerning the sciences developed in the Near East between the -XXXIIIth century (BC) and the + 15th century (AD), are exposed in this book. The first part concerns the fundamental contribution of the cultures of the ancient Near East to the birth and development of the sciences, between the -XXXIIIth century and the +7th century.
The question of the transmission of these sciences to other civilizations of the Mediterranean, before the 8th century, arises. On this specific theme, the elements provided by the sources are supplemented by the study of credible hypotheses on some aspects of this transmission and seem to shed new light. The second part of the book first draws up an assessment of the knowledge relating to the old heritages, at the origin of the birth of a new scientific and technological phase in the Middle East, and this from + 8th century.
Another, provisional, sheds light on the content of the tradition between the 4th and 15th centuries; period of great scientific development within the Arab-Muslim empire and its civilization, with significant extensions beyond its borders, to the East and the West."
